# Introduction: The Payment Problem

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

In Uganda, like many developing countries, people frequently need to split expenses:

### Real Ugandan Scenarios

**🏠 Roommate Rent Splitting**
```
John, Sarah, and David share a 3-bedroom apartment
Rent: 800,000 UGX/month
Utilities: 150,000 UGX/month
Total: 950,000 UGX/month

Problem: Who collects the money? Who tracks who paid?
```

**🍽️ Restaurant Bills**
```
5 friends at Cafe Javas
Total bill: 75,000 UGX
Some ordered expensive drinks, others just coffee
Problem: How to split fairly?
```

**🏍️ Boda Boda Sharing**
```
4 friends going to the same event
Boda ride: 8,000 UGX each
Problem: Who pays the driver? How to collect from others?
```

### Traditional Problems

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Cash Handling** | Risk of loss, theft, or miscounting |
| **Trust Issues** | "Did John really pay his share?" |
| **Manual Calculations** | Math errors, especially with percentages |
| **No Records** | No proof of payments made |
| **Geographic Limitations** | Hard to collect from people in different locations |

## 💡 The Blockchain Solution

Our **Payment Splitter DApp** solves these problems using blockchain technology:

### How It Works

1. **Create Payment Split** - Define who gets what percentage
2. **Contributors Pay** - Each person sends their share directly
3. **Automatic Distribution** - When target is reached, funds are distributed
4. **Transparent Records** - All transactions are visible on blockchain

### Example: Restaurant Bill

```solidity
// Create payment split for 5 people
createPayment(
    "Cafe Javas Dinner",
    75000, // 75,000 UGX in wei
    [
        "0x1234...", // John - 25%
        "0x5678...", // Sarah - 20%
        "0x9abc...", // David - 25%
        "0xdef0...", // Mary - 15%
        "0x1111..."  // Peter - 15%
    ],
    [25, 20, 25, 15, 15] // Percentages
)
```

### Benefits for Ugandan Context

| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| **No Cash Handling** | Eliminates theft and miscounting |
| **Automatic Math** | No calculation errors |
| **Permanent Records** | Blockchain proof of all payments |
| **Cross-Border** | Works for Ugandans abroad |
| **Mobile-Friendly** | Works on smartphones |
| **Low Fees** | Celo network has minimal transaction costs |
